## Abstract
Glacier dynamics remain a major source of uncertainty in sea level rise predictions (Stocker et al., 2013)
and therefore still need to be better understood in places like Svalbard, known as one of the most climatically
sensitive regions in the world (Rogers et al., 2005). 
In this study, the potential of long-term GNSS records at Holtedahfonna ice field and Etonbreen glacier is investigated to study short-term velocity events. Three
automatic methods were developed in order to post-process the data as objectively as possible by getting rid of
thresholds fixing. To this end, the data behaviour has been studied with regard to a range of parameterisations
and the help of the elbow method (Satopaa et al., 2011). The comparison of the resulted daily velocities showed
slight but unexpected variations depending on the method used. These methods have then been compared
to others used in previous studies (Helbing (2005); Sugiyama et al. (2015)) which brought into light a high
sensitivity of the data depending on the post-processing. Thereafter, a temporal resolution increase revealed a
first change in the data behaviour of Holtedahlfonna ice field at an eight-hour and twelve-hour resolution (for
respectively 2011 and 2012) while studying the developed methods independently but also among themselves.
Finally, a glaciological interpretation consisting in the comparison a mean daily velocity to surface mass balance
model outputs showed that even at this scale, various processes associated with a potential hydrometeorological
forcing can ben explained. It is therefore highly encouraging for further temporal resolution investigations and
thus, for a better understanding of short-term glacier dynamics.
